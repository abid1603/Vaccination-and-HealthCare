                            <h3>Ensuring Newborn Survival</h3>

                            <p>  The first month of a child’s life – the neonatal, or newborn period – carries the highest risk of death.
                                 It is also the most dangerous period for the newborn’s mother. Globally, 2.5 million newborns die each year, 2.6 million 
                                 babies are stillborn, and 303,000 women die as a consequence of pregnancy or childbirth. More than 1 million newborns die on the first 
                                 day of life, making the day of birth the most dangerous day for babies in nearly every country. Newborn deaths have decreased from 5 million
                                 in 1990 to 2.5 million in 2017. However, this decline has 
                                 been slower than for deaths of children under age 5 that occur after the first month of life.

                                 <br />
                                 The good news is that proven and cost-effective interventions, ranging from improved quality of antenatal care to 
                                 skilled birth attendance to ensuring warmth and initiating breastfeeding at birth, have the potential to
                                  reduce the number of neonatal deaths and stillbirths, and many of these interventions can be taken to scale.

                                  Since 2000, thanks to joint efforts by multiple national and global stakeholders, low-income countries have recognized
                                   that focusing on newborn survival is critically important if they are to succeed in achieving the United Nations' ambitious goal
                                    of ending preventable deaths of newborns and children and reducing the
                                   neonatal mortality rate to 12 per 1,000 live births by 2030 – the mandate of Sustainable Development Goal 3.

                            <p>Save the Children's Saving Newborn Lives (SNL) program is a globally recognized leader in newborn health. 
                                Since 2000, SNL has worked to raise awareness, conduct research and support country- and global-level efforts to institutionalize 
                                equitable and highly effective coverage of high-impact newborn services and practices at national scale.

                                <br />
                                SNL works with governments and partners to keep newborn health on global and national agendas, and catalyzes action by developing,
                                 applying and documenting evidence-based newborn care services and practices. In addition, SNL promotes the increased availability of 
                                 and access to routine and emergency newborn care services and supplies, improved quality of newborn care services and dissemination of
                                  evidence about and creation of increased demand for newborn care. SNL works with global partners and in four priority countries, collaborating
                                   with country governments,
                                 development partners, civil society and other strategic partners to catalyze action to improve health outcomes for newborns.
